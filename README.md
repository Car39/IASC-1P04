# Bff by Carly Faulds
## IASC 1P04

Bff is a short adventure game where players must try and repair an old friendship between themselves and an NPC. Players will choose carefully when engaging in conversation with the NPC since the game itself and the NPC are very fragile and have the possibility to break. Decide how you want to approach this situation for it is the player who has control over what outcome occurs. Bff conveys the idea that NPC's have feelings so treat others the way you would like to be treated.
